# Tilt
This is a pet project that I'm working on to get more experience with React Native development as well as trying to tie in some sensor integration.

Its a mobile version of the classic marble game where you tilt (in this case your phone) to try to navigate the marble past a bunch of holes and make it to the end of the course.
